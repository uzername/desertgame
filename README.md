Here is a desert game written in sophisticated JS. It uses Webpack. Make sure that tools like npv, npm, npx, and webpack are installed.

Then, delete thingies in /dist/ folder. in root folder of project run `npx webpack`. To test things use `npm i -g live-server` (this command is for installing a live server) and `npm run start` (this command is for running live server) while staying in root folder.

dist/desertgame.js is a final file
